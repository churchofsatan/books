Anton Szandor LaVey, born Howard Stanton Levey on April 11, 1930, was raised in Chicago by parents who had moved there by the turn of the century. During his youth, LaVey developed a keen interest in musical instruments, notably the piano and other keyboards, which he played for his local church and high school. LaVey's classmates were drawn to his "out of the norm" mystic personality, and he began to develop a disdain for media, which he described as having a "see what the weird kid is doing, then go back to hating them" mentality.

At age 16, LaVey dropped out of school and joined a local carnival attraction. During his time in the circus, he observed otherwise high-standard, moral Christian men and women indulging in activities they preached against, only to repent in church the next day. These experiences, whether accurately recounted or not, were foundational in the development of LaVey's early Satanic beliefs.

In the 1960s, LaVey further developed his philosophy and religious intent, delving deeper into established philosophical ideologies and shaping the Church of Satan's doctrines. On April 30, 1966, during Walpurgisnacht, LaVey shaved his head in a ritualistic act reminiscent of executioners and black magicians, declaring the establishment of Year One, Anno Satanasâ€”the first year of Satan's reign. The Church of Satan was formally established to house the philosophy, beliefs, and religion of Satanism.

LaVey described the Church of Satan as a "temple of indulgence" meant to defy the abstinent temples that had preceded it. The Church's purpose was to be a welcoming, fun place rather than an unforgiving one. By 1967, the Church of Satan had become the center of major media attention, starting with the first official Satanic wedding ceremony on February 1, which drew a large crowd of reporters and required police intervention.

The Church gained further public recognition when LaVey was dubbed the "Black Pope." In December 1967, LaVey conducted a funeral for Mrs. Edward Olsen's husband, a U.S. Navy member. Despite initial resistance from Navy officials, the ceremony proceeded, blending Satanic and naval traditions. This event led to the Church of Satan's inclusion in the U.S. Military Chaplain's Handbook and an increase in self-identified Satanists in the military.

LaVey continued his work with the Church until his death in 1997, after which his daughter briefly took over before Peter Gilmore became the current High Priest. LaVey's legacy endures, with Satanists today practicing their beliefs internationally in numbers far greater than during LaVey's time. This legacy is deeply honored and demonstrated by a new generation of Satanists.

That's all for today's lecture. Hail Satan!
