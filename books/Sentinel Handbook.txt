 The Sentinels’ Handbook: Official Guidelines for the Moderation Team

 Introduction

Hello, and welcome to the official handbook for Moderators! All the information you need is in this document. Keep this tab open at all times while moderating the Discord server. Be sure to read the entire document to ensure your job is being done adequately. Moderators are tasked with moderating the Discord server, ranking new members from Pupil to Student, handling ban appeals, and serving as a last resort if protectors aren’t at the church. If you have any questions, contact the Head of Moderation for assistance.

 Rankings

- Counselor Advisor: Chosen by the Head of Moderation, this individual assists the Head of Moderation and may assume their position if necessary.
- Administrators: Highly active, they clean the Discord server, rank members from pupil to student, and assist protectors in-game.
- Moderators: Skilled in their tasks, they frequently clean the Discord channels, rank members, and enforce rules in both the Discord server and in-game.
- Midway Moderators: Moderately experienced, they rank members to scholars and above and are on their way to becoming outstanding Moderators.
- Trial Moderators: New recruits getting accustomed to the handbook and basic tasks like ranking verified pupils to students and cleaning the Discord server.

Tasks: Moderators moderate the server, rank verified pupils to students, and serve as a last resort for protectors. Remove the pupil role from members no longer in the group. Follow the handbook precisely, as administrative actions are taken seriously. Mistakes can result in strikes or demotion.

1. Go to the rank-up-request channel.
2. Copy the username of the person requesting a rank.
3. Go to the Roblox group and select ‘configure group’.
4. Paste the member’s username in the search bar and rank them to student.
5. Return to the Discord server, and add the student role to their profile.
6. Add a reaction to the rank-up request to signify completion.

Training: Covers all tasks of a moderator, including the discord rules and the handbook. Training may also include topics on burnout, mental health, and more. Typically, training is provided for all new trial moderators and as needed for midway and above moderators.

 Handling Tickets

Ping inactive tickets after 3 days, and close if there is no response. Handle trolling according to protocols and end interactions formally.

 Ban Appeals

Only the Head of Moderation and Counselor Advisor can accept and log ban appeals. Accepted individuals undergo a 2-week probation. Any rule-breaking during probation results in an instant ban without appeal.

Example of Preaching:
- Saying “You should believe in God” or “Satan is bad because God said so” is preaching.

Examples of NSFW:
- NSFW profile pictures (explicit content) and statuses with explicit language must be addressed according to the protocol.

Rule-Breaking Examples:
- Extremism/Animal Torture
- Slur Usage
- NSFW Content
- Spamming and Preaching
- Underaged Members

 In-Game Moderation Guide

People of certain ranks are allowed on stage. Follow the same moderation protocols for spammers, trollers, preachers, harassers, and racists as in Discord. Use appropriate commands for warnings, muting, jailing, kicking, and banning.

 Ban Appeals

Members banned for graphic content, serious threats, NSFW content, gore, IP grabbing, and extremism are not eligible for appeals. Other banned members can apply for an appeal. If accepted, they undergo a 2-week probation and must adhere strictly to rules, or face an instant ban without further appeals. 

Signed, Head of Moderation, Maeror
