[TSC Official] Version 1.0 The Board of Community Interests Handbook Official Guidelines for the Community Advisors

Introduction
Hello, and welcome to the official handbook for Community Advisors! This document contains all the information you need. Keep this tab open at all times while communicating with others about their needs. Be sure to read the entire handbook to ensure your job is done adequately. Community Advisors are tasked with being the voice of the community, planning events, helping the council with their schedules, and acting as a last resort if protectors aren’t at the church. If you have any unanswered questions, reach out to the Community Manager for assistance.

Expectations
Behavior, Communication, and Activity
Maintain good professional behavior to provide a positive image for yourself, the division, and the community. Dress appropriately and keep interactions PG-13. Failure to do so will result in a strike or demotion. Communicate cooperatively with other advisors to ensure smooth operations and create strong bonds. Stay active by ensuring your notifications are on so you can assist when needed and host events for members.

Tasks
Community Advisors handle behind-the-scenes operations, host events to keep members active and happy, and act as the voice between members and the council. Tasks include handling schedules, hosting group events, helping members communicate with staff, and assisting in planning events with other divisions.

Training
Trainings review all the tasks of an advisor and everything you need to know. They include an overview of situations to help with, as well as the handbook. You'll be asked various questions to test how you'll handle different situations. Training may also cover topics such as burnout and mental health.

In-game “Moderation” Guide
Community Advisors are not moderators. While we play a crucial role in the community, our primary function is to advise and assist rather than directly moderate gameplay interactions. Community Advisors serve as trusted mentors, offering support and guidance. However, we may step in to address situations requiring immediate attention, particularly when moderators or protectors are unavailable. Our dedicated moderation and protection team is responsible for upholding community guidelines. Please refrain from acting as moderators unless necessary. Spend at least three hours in-game but focus on being active in the server and checking the server suggestions channel. Send at least 20 work-related messages in the BCI discord server weekly.

This document is subject to change as our division develops. Please check in often!

Community Manager,
