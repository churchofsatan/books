The following books will be separated denominationally. Not all groups of Satanists believe the same things.
I will list readings from the two most common modern sects, and several other readings which I think are most relevant.

1. Church of Satan Satanism:
The Nine Satanic Statements
The Nine Satanic Sins
The Satanic Bible
The Satanic Rituals
The Satanic Scriptures

2. Other Satanism:
The Happy Satanist
The Bible of the Adversary

3. Pertinent Philosophy:
Twilight of the Idols (Morality as the Enemy of Nature)
The Myth of Sisyphus
Existentialism is a Humanism
The Death of Ivan Ilyich
On the Duty of Civil Disobedience
The Complete Guide to Street Epistemology
The Antichrist
The Logic of Scientific Discovery
The Ethic of Liberty
The Righteous Mind

Final note:
Beware of theistic Satanism, as it is often full of extremist and manipulative dogma.
Most of all, have fun, and take out the best parts that are useful to you. Satanism, unlike most organized religion, does not claim infallibility. It is a religion made by humans, for humans, so if you are interested, make it work for you.
