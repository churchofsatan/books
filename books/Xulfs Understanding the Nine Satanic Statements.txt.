Hail Satan! In Nomine Dei Nostri Satanas, Luciferi Excelsi. In the Name of Satan, Ruler of the Earth, True God, Almighty and Ineffable, Who hast created man to reflect in Thine own image and likeness, I invite the Forces of Darkness to bestow their infernal power upon me. Open the Gates of Hell to come forth to greet me as your Brother/Sister and friend. Deliver me O Mighty Satan from all past error and delusion, fill me with truth, wisdom and understanding, keep me strong in my faith and service, that I may abide always in Thee with Praise, Honor and Glory be given Thee forever and ever. Ave.

I would like to warmly welcome everyone to tonight's sermon, a rather important and remarkable one at that. We will be discussing tonight a critical piece of satanic text: The Nine Satanic Statements as quoted by LaVey. Each statement is a reflection on the religious practices and beliefs of Satanism, along with its participant's daily lives. These statements are the foundations of our modern belief, and to come furthermore. Let us begin:

"Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence!" This is our first statement. Commonly taught in many major global religions is the concept of abstinence, to devoid one's self of a specific item, activity, or thing that may bring pleasure in accordance to the teachings of a specific god or deity, think asceticism promoted in Buddhism to reach Nirvana, avoidance to beef products in Hinduism. So on so forth.

Apologies, disconnected. Continuing onwards: Apologies about the delay. There might be a possible outside disruption to the game, please be patient. Satanism denounces this notion of depriving oneself of things that bring pleasure to them, though of course to a reasonable degree. Satanism instead teaches the individual to live in indulgence with every opportunity they choose to take part in, for the Satanist realizes their time on earth is a brief, precious one that shouldn't be wasted on the concept of rewards in the afterlife for sacrifices during life.

"Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams!" This is our second statement. As mentioned before, the Satanist believes that time on earth is a brief, precious one. How one chooses to live it is ultimately up to the individual, for better or for worse. Yet, what separates a Satanist from a Christian or any other Theist is the idea that you'll be rewarded in the afterlife for living your life a specific way in accordance to a divine being's teachings, praying and the sorts. Satanists do not believe in any sort of notion, nor do they believe in any sort of esoteric nonsense that may "enrich" someone's wealth or status in life. While some Satanists may collect shiny gems or cool-looking tarot cards for their own personal altars, it is for the sake of aesthetics rather than any legitimate belief in the supernatural.

A quick reminder: You may view logs of our sermons in our server. Join up today to always stay educated on the matter. "Satan represents undefiled wisdom instead of hypocritical self-deceit!" Everyone holds a certain belief close to their heart, one that they might even die or struggle for. Now, take a certain belief you yourself tend to hold near and dear to your heart and challenge it. Analyze your personal understanding of your belief, come up with arguments against that belief, and observe your emotions towards them. More often than not, a person might feel angry, repressive, or outright distraught to face such overwhelming pushback towards their beliefs, that is if they themselves do not hold as much depth to it as they thought they had. Hypocritical self-deceit comes in many forms, either by telling yourself that that one certain food item you dislike is going to be good for the 40th time around, or by living in ignorance to newfound information for the sake of clinging onto what your family or friends might've told you was right to begin with. Simply put, Satanism advocates for the pursuit of malleable wisdom through learned reason rather than static dogma perpetuated by word of mouth.

"Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of love wasted on ingrates!" The people you stick around with will ultimately become the very people who shape your perceptions, your quirks, your attitude, even tweak that small niche you carry. For conversing and being sociable this is all well and good, wisdom too carries from it. However, if it's these crowds that do not appreciate you, that could care less for your well being, cut any interaction with them, it's more than absolute in your self interest. Your expressions of gratitude, of kindness, of favors and gifts, are all of your own choice as appreciation to the ones who have shown equal care towards you. When these expressions feel forced rather than genuine, you degrade yourself as an individual and these ingrates take the joy out of your existence. Satanism does not tolerate these ingrates who take your kindness and slap you harshly with it. Satanists seek to destroy any presence of ungratefulness, for it has no reason to linger around.

"Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek!" Arguably, this is one of the most decisive and personal statements that first strikes learning readers. We all have those bullies or jerks who pop up once every so while in our lives that seek to be nothing more than pests for a while. It does no one good to keep these pests around, and unfortunately as is often taught, turning the other cheek only encourages them to writhe around and annoy you further. A momentary nuisance is nothing to worry much about, but when it comes to those who actively seek to harm your well being through one means or another- it is better to show no mercy, to reasonably destroy what it is that is after you, and to ensure it does not continue to bother you. Continuing with the theme that is evident in all nine statements, this one encourages the most direct form of self preservation above all.

"Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concern for psychic vampires!" LaVey uses the term "psychic vampires" in this statement, and really all that term means is anyone who is toxic towards you. A core belief of the Satanist is to hold accountability to one's own actions and to never blame others for what clearly was the choice of the individual. To quote, "With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility." Our own ability to be constantly conscious and self-thinking is the most powerful force wielded in the history of Earth's life, and with such a power comes great responsibility to use it wisely. Those who act passive aggressive towards you, never want to hang out, and still expect everything out of you when they care little for you,- are nothing more than the "psychic vampires" spoken about earlier these people who feed off of your charity. A common trait amongst them is when you call them out, they blame it on a rough day or their own diagnosed issue of the week. Take the satanic route and cut any reason to associate with them!

"Satan represents man as just another animal - who, because of his “divine spiritual and intellectual development,” has become the most vicious animal of all!" The last, and arguably the most realizing statement to us all. The concept of man as being some sort of divine being because of their intellect above all is a ridiculous notion. Man is an interesting animal, one that has built complex networks, societies, technology, one who has even restructured and studied its own DNA, and yet despite all of this, still bleeds red and still can age. In the halls of man's endless creations, the concept of Morality is one that is truly abusive. The belief we are all but a moral beacon of life on this earth is nothing more than a fresh wound waiting to be ripped open further for many other people. To truly be "moral" to ourselves, we mustn't seek the divine cleanliness of a God, but rather engage in the human, animalistic side of our urges, of our indulgences.

"Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification!" This statement speaks for itself really. As we have gone over in all of the previous statements so far,- the common theme has been the desire to indulge in the sinful fruits of earth that would make a puritan faint, all the while ensuring your safety and well being to continue on- with said indulgences and gratification. Man is not restricted to books but by their own conscious, individual actions. And most revelating of them all:

"Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had, as He has kept it in business all these years!" All institutions are built with a common goal in mind, a conscious ideology that can be shaped to fit the institution's desires at all times. Though, to instill activity and obedience from followers, it is much cheaper to give them something to fear about. Eternal punishment in the afterlife is your typical route when it comes to religious institutions, but more often than not they are much more insidious than that- other times it is the dishonor of your people, of your country, the selfish abandonment of what the institution has "given" to you. Truly, the chain and ball of eternal consequence has been the best friend of Churches, Mosques, Businesses, and Ideologies. Without it, they would seek to have purpose, to have the manpower they do have. With this in mind, remember to always look towards what is condemned by a certain group before you engage further with them, what is THEIR Satan like?

And with that, those are the Nine Satanic Statements. These statements serve as the main philosophies of Satanism as a whole, as best explained in such a limited space. If you wish to find further clarification on any of these statements, the official Church of Satan page has additional resources.
