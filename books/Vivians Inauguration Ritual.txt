In the dim light of the ceremony room encircled by flickering candles, Arcturus stood at the center, beginning with an invocation: "We gather here in the presence of the infernal flames to witness the ascension of one of our dedicated servants, Vivian. May the spirits of our forebearers and the power of the abyss guide us in this sacred ritual."

Gesturing for Vivian to step forward into the circle, Arcturus addressed her: "Vivian, you have served our community with diligence and fervor. Today, you stand before us ready to ascend to The Infernal Council. Are you prepared to undertake the responsibilities and vows that this position entails?"

Vivian responded affirmatively, expressing her readiness to join the council: "I am ready to serve the Church of Satan as a member of the Infernal Council and uphold the sacred vows."

Arcturus presented each vow individually. Vivian repeated each one, affirming her commitment:
"May we never abuse our power as Councilors of this group."
"May we never make an action to slander the image of this group, her people, or her leading body."
"May our intent always be to do what is best for this community as a whole, instead of unfair favoritism or selfishness."
"May we do everything in our power, no matter the cost, to protect this group from all manners of harm. Both internal, external, and ourselves."
"May we be as transparent with the community as possible, revealing all information relevant to the community."
"May we always act with preparation and preparedness in any official act of this community, delivering swift and efficient implementation."
"We find it self-evident that these vows only change with the COMPLETE approval from the Council and the Directorate of Confraternity Affairs."
Vivian added her final vow: “May there be no more ignorance in me, may Darkness take from me all my doubts and so become the Nemesis of those who do not seek knowledge, and become the Way for those who seek to know.”

Arcturus then addressed Vivian: "With these vows, you are cleansed of past roles and reborn as a protector and guide of our sacred council." He presented her with a Golden Chalice, initiating the ritual's effects.

Leading the council in a collective oath, Arcturus declared: "We, the Infernal Council, welcome Vivian among our ranks. We vow to support and guide her in her duties, holding her to the highest standards of our vows and principles."

Invoking a final blessing, Arcturus consecrated Vivian as High Priestess of the Infernal Council: "By the power vested in me, I consecrate Vivian as High Priestess of the Infernal Council. May you lead with wisdom, integrity, and unwavering commitment to our cause."

Concluding the ritual, Arcturus announced: "The ascension is complete. Let us now celebrate the strengthening of our council and the continued prosperity of the Church. Hail Satan!"
