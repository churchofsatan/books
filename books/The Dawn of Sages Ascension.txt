Ceremony Date: June 1st, 2024
This event took place in the 2019 version of the church, at the request of Sage.

Arcturus stands behind the podium and calls out, “Come forth, our new Infernal King.” The candidate walks out and stands in front of the podium, facing Arcturus. He begins with an invocation:

“Welcome, students, to the most sacred of ceremonies in TSC. We gather here under the watchful eyes of the infernal flames to witness the ascension of Xshadowsage, a heavily devoted councilor. Let the spirits of our forebearers and the power of the infernal abyss guide us tonight.”

“Sage, you have served our community with unwavering dedication. Today, you stand before us, ready to ascend as the new spearhead of TSC. Are you prepared to accept the responsibilities and vows that come with this position?” asks Arcturus.

“I am ready to serve the Church of Satan as the Infernal Emperor and uphold the sacred vows,” replies Sage.

“Sage, do you pledge to uphold our community's values and principles with steadfast commitment?” Arcturus continues.

“I do, with all my heart and soul,” Sage affirms.

Arcturus then presents each vow individually. Sage repeats each one, affirming their commitment:

“May we never abuse our power as Councilors of this group.”

“May we never take actions that slander the image of this group, her people, or her leading body.”

“May our intentions always be for the betterment of this community, avoiding unfair favoritism and selfishness.”

“May we do everything in our power, no matter the cost, to protect this group from all harm, whether internal, external, or from ourselves.”

“May we be as transparent with the community as possible, sharing all relevant information.”

“May we always act with preparation and efficiency in any official act of this community.”

“We find it self-evident that these vows may only be changed with the complete approval of the Council and the Directorate of Confraternity Affairs.”

Arcturus continues, “With these vows, you are reborn as the Infernal Emperor, the protector and guide of our sacred council. I will now crown you as Infernal Emperor.” Arcturus crowns Sage.

“We, the Infernal Council, welcome Sage as our new Infernal Emperor. We vow to support and guide them in their duties, holding them to the highest standards of our vows and principles.”

“By the power vested in me, I consecrate Sage as the Infernal Emperor and spearhead of the Church of Satan. May you lead with wisdom, neutrality, integrity, and unwavering commitment to our cause.”

Sage then gives a speech to the audience. He begins with stating, “For years, I have been council of TSC since the beginning of 2019.” He continues, “I have seen this group go through trials and tribulations, and seen its greatest events. I have served this community with all my heart and soul so that maybe one day you can call me leader and king.”

Sage pauses and then goes on, “To serve you as my faithful community is what empowers me. From TSC's second head of protection up until now as owner, I will do whatever I can to serve you, just as you serve this community. I chose this place because this is where everything started as CoS/TSC.”

He adds, “I thank all of you for uplifting me, especially Arc, Skelm, and Asmodeus. Words cannot describe how long I've chased this position, and as some of you know, the event that happened in TSC years ago prevented me from such position. Again, thank you all.”

Sage concludes with, “Hail Satan, hail thy community, and hail thyself.”

Arcturus then concludes, “The ascension is complete. Let us now celebrate the strengthening of our council and the continued prosperity of the Church. Hail Satan!”
