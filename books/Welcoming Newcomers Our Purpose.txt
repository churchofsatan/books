Sermon Date: April 21st, 2024
Ave, everyone! Good day to you all. I see a lot of new guests have arrived, so I'll go over the main focus of our group and the purpose of this game.

This Church was created with the sole purpose of providing a source of Satanic knowledge to all those who wish to learn, and to provide a community for all types of Satanists to feel welcome. Just like all religions, Satanism has many branches and denominations within it. Due to this, this group does not declare itself as any specific branch or denomination of Satanism. Instead, let this group serve as a platform to purge ignorance and allow a path of education, freethinking, and fun. This is a game after all. However, it should go to say that we, as a community, should not tolerate nor teach extremism.

This particular mindset allows all people of any religion to join and learn about the principles, philosophy, theories, and ideologies of all kinds of Satanism, both modern and archaic, in a fun manner. Unlike what you may expect, we speak here to answer questions to the curious and to always encourage questioning instead of conforming to the usual religious practice. Those of suppressing questions with absurd distortions of emotions and reality alike.

We remain here to retain our individualism and thus only loosely adhere to dogmatic practices, as dogma is a necessity of religion. Finally, we are here not to change the world around us, as we understand not all are meant to be Satanists. Instead, we are here so that the world may not change us for the worse.

Sermons in-game are hosted by our Education division several times weekly, so be sure to stick around. We also host community events for our family, like movie nights, avatar contests, hide and seek, etc. Lastly, I want to thank the community for helping us reach 3k in so little time. There's a long road ahead of us hosting a lot of changes!

Thank you everyone. Hail Satan, Hail Thyself, and long live the church!
